    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: City Simulator</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project after the 2 weeks of bootcamp demonstrates the use and understanding
	of arrays, classes, loops and interactions with conditions. I have created a city scene, where I have
	used parameters to specify the posittion of each building and the use of loops to create many windows 
	which can be turned on or off. I have used arrays to produce purple rain droplets as well as snow, which
	vary in both size and speed, to fabricate the impression of distance (the smaller the droplet/snow the 
	slower they fall). I have also imbedded car images to produce a busy road and finally interactions
	to change the time of day.
